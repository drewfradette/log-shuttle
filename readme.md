# Log Shuttle

Log-shuttle is an open source UNIX program that delivers messages from
applications and daemons to log routers and processors via HTTPs.

One of the motivations behind log-shuttle is to provide a simpler form of
encrypted & authenticated log delivery. Using HTTPs & Basic Authentication is
simpler than the techniques described in RFC5425. TLS transport mapping for
Syslog requires that you maintain both client & server certificates for
authentication. In multi-tenant environments, the maintenance of certificate
management can be quite burdensome.

When using log-shuttle with logplex it is recommended that you spawn 1
log-shuttle per logplex token. This will isolate data between customers and
ensure a good QoS. Log-shuttle accepts input from stdin in a newline (\n)
delimited format. 

When using log-shuttle with [Amazon's
Kinesis]("http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/"), all the details for the region,
stream and access credentials are supplied in the -logs-url (or $LOGS_URL env
variable). See the Kinesis setion of this document.

To block as little as possible, log-shuttle will drop outstanding batches if
it accumulates > -back-buff amount.

## Kinesis

Kinesis expects a single "record" per put, but log-shuttle can encode multiple
log lines into a single put request. If you want to maintain a 1 to 1 ratio of
log lines to records, set the -batch-size=1. Otherwise use a small batch size
somewhere in the 2-5 lines range, modulo your expected log line max length. ATM
Kinesis has a 50KB record size, so base64(max log line size * batch size) can't
be more than 50KB. log-shuttle does not (atm) enforce this, so you may see lost
batches if you start going over this limit.

Since Kinesis record sizes are pretty small, the -drop flag, which defaults to
true (existing behaviour), has been added. If -drop=false then log-shuttle does
not drop. Log-shuttle can still loose messages because of destination errors
thought.

Log-shuttle expects the following encoding of -logs-url when using Amazon
Kinesis:

    ```
    https://<AWS_KEY>:<AWS_SECRET>@kinesis.<AMAZON_REGION>.amazonaws.com/<STREAM NAME>
    ```

See the [Amazon Endpoints
documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ak_region)
for supported regions and hostnames.

## Hacking on log-shuttle

Fork the repo, hack, submit PRs.

### Local Setup

```bash
$ go version
go version go1.3.3 darwin/amd64
# go get -u github.com/tools/godep
$ go get github.com/heroku/log-shuttle
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/heroku/log-shuttle

### Replacing local syslog

Libc uses a local AF_UNIX SOCK_DGRAM (or SOCK_STREAM) for syslog(3) calls. Most unix utils use the syslog(3) call to log to syslog. You can have log-shuttle transport those messages too with a little help from some other standard unix programs.

1. Stop your local syslog
2. rm -f /dev/log
3. us netcat, tr, stdbuf to read connections to /dev/log and convert the \0 terminator to \n

Like so...

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/rsyslog stop
sudo rm -f /dev/log
(sudo nc -n -k -d -Ul /dev/log & until [ ! -e /dev/log ]; do sleep 0.01; done; sudo chmod a+rw /dev/log) | stdbuf -i0 -o0 tr \\0 \\n | ./log-shuttle -logs-url=... ... -input-format=1
```
